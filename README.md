# AIND-Soduku
In this project, you will be writing code to implement two extensions of our sudoku solver. The first one will be to implement the technique called "naked twins". The second one will be to modify our existing code to solve a diagonal sudoku. To complete this project you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson, and build upon them.
